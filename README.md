## Installation

I recommend installing `pip-abandoned` with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/). This will give you a system-wide install of `pip-abandoned` with its dependencies isolated from any environments you intend to scan.

Alternatively `pip-abandoned` can be installed from PyPI with your package manager of choice: pip, poetry, pipenv, etc.

## Introduction

Some package registries like NPM and Packagist allow a user to mark a package as abandoned or deprecated. This means it is relatively easy to tell if you are relying on a package abandoned by its author. It also allows package managers to consume this metadata to provide a warning at install time. PyPI does not have a mechanism to abandon or deprecate a package. There are some signals we can look at though.

- Many packages are linked to a GitHub repository. If that GitHub repository is archived, this is a strong signal that the package itself is abandoned
- Some packages may use the `Development Status :: 7 - Inactive` trove classifier to indicate the package is not actively maintained
- Some packages may include a ![not maintained](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/no/2023) badge in the project README to indicate the package is not actively maintained

`pip-abandoned` uses these signals to identify potentially abandoned packages in your environment.

## Authentication

`pip-abandoned` uses the GitHub GraphQL API to efficiently query many repos at once. The advantage of this is that it is fast. The tradeoff is that authentication is required. A PAT with read-only access to public repos will be sufficient for most cases. There are two ways we can provide an auth token:

- Via an environment variable called `GH_TOKEN` e.g: `GH_TOKEN=ghp_abc123`
- Run `pip-abandoned set-token` to store a token using the system keyring service with [keyring](https://pypi.org/project/keyring/)

## Usage

An example invocation of `pip-abandoned` looks like:

```bash
pip-abandoned search /home/alice/.virtualenvs/myproject/lib/python3.10/site-packages
```

## Exit Codes

`pip-abandoned search` exits with

- code `0` when no inactive, archived or unmaintained packages were found
- code `1` when an error was encountered. For example:
  - no packages were supplied in the path provided or
  - no auth token was supplied
- code `9` when one or more inactive, archived or unmaintained packages were found

## Inspiration

`pip-abandoned` takes inspiration from [pip-audit](https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit), another great project.
